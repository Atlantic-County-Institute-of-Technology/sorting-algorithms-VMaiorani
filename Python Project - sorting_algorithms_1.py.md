# Unit 2 Project - sorting_algorithms_1.py

### *"Insertion sort walked into a bar... and carefully finds its place between two other patrons"*

## Overview
This project builds upon our understanding of sorting algorithms, menus, and data structure manipulation. We'll create a menu-driven program that allows users to analyse different sorting algorithms like **Bubble sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort**.

---

## Key Requirements
By the end of this project, your program should allow for the following functionality:

[//]: # (- [ ] **Allow the user to choose** their preferred sorting method with a main menu. This menu should also clear the screen upon making each selection.)
- [ ] **Validate user input**, like the following:
	- Making sure the list size is a positive integer.
	- Validating that the minimum range is less than the maximum range for values in the list.
	- Handling invalid menu selections gracefully.
- [ ] **Generate a list of integer values**, and allow the user to change both the number and range of those values.

[//]: # (- [ ] **Perform a Bubble Sort** correctly and efficiently *&#40;Note: this will only be required to work, it has already been graded&#41;*)

[//]: # (- [ ] **Perform an Insertion Sort** correctly and efficiently.)

[//]: # (- [ ] **Perform a Selection Sort** correctly and efficiently.)
- [ ] **Display performance metrics**, including the following for each sort:
	- The number of times a loop has executed.
	- The number of "sorting actions" (swapping, inserting, etc.) that have occurred.
	- The time (in seconds) it took for that algorithm to complete.

## Submission Guidelines
Please submit your file by pushing all changes to your assigned git repository. Your project submission should consist of **4** files:
1. lastname_menu.py - The main program file with user interface and list generation.
2. bubble_sort.py - Bubble sort implementation.
3. insertion_sort.py - Insertion sort implementation.
4. selection_sort.py - Selection sort implementation.
Additionally, include the following:
- **At least three** screenshots of terminal output done from your own testing. Include them in a folder labelled "Screenshots".

# Specification Grade Criteria

This project has a total of **35** points, **5** for each specification above. The chart below outlines what constitutes each point rating.

| Score | Problem Solving                                                                                                                                  |

| 5     | Response gives evidence of a complete understanding of the problem; is fully developed; is clearly communicated.                                 |
| 4     | Response gives the evidence of a clear understanding of the problem but contains minor errors or is not fully communicated.                      |
| 3     | Response gives evidence of a reasonable approach but indicates gaps in conceptual understanding. Explanations are incomplete, vague, or muddled. |
| 2     | Response gives some evidence of problem understanding but contains major programming or reasoning errors.                                        |
| 1     | No response or response is completely incorrect or irrelevant.                                                                                   |
